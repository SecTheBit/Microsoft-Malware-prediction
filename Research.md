# Microsoft-Malware-prediction

## About

This is just a simple and small research kind of work which will helps you to build an AI model to predict the probability of your windows machine getting infected by a malware. The dataset for this work have been taken from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/microsoft-malware-prediction/data) , Which contains millions of records of windows machine and their status of being affected by a malware. The dataset contains total of 84 features from which  I have used only 15 features and only 1 lakh data, due to less RAM, for training the model and i got a accuracy of approx 60% in the end. 

## Features

There total of 84 features but i have used only following 15 features.
```
ProductName -  Defender state information e.g. win8defender

EngineVersion -  Defender state information e.g. 1.1.12603.0

DefaultBrowsersIdentifier -  ID for the machine's default browser  

CountryIdentifier -  ID for the country the machine is located in            

Platform -  Calculates platform name (of OS related properties and processor property)                     

Processor - This is the process architecture of the installed operating system                     

OsVer -  Version of the current operating system                         

IsProtected - This is a calculated field derived from the Spynet Report's AV Products field. Returns: a. TRUE if there is at least one active and up-to-date antivirus product 
running on this machine. b. FALSE if there is no active AV product on this machine, or if the AV is active, but is not receiving the latest updates. c. null if there are no Anti Virus Products in the report. Returns: Whether a machine is protected.                  

Firewall - This attribute is true (1) for Windows 8.1 and above if windows firewall is enabled, as reported by the service.                     

UacLuaenable  -  This attribute reports whether or not the "administrator in Admin Approval Mode" user type is disabled or enabled in UAC. The value reported is obtained by reading the regkey HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System\EnableLUA

Census_IsVirtualDevice -  Identifies a Virtual Machine (machine learning model)        

Census_IsTouchEnabled - Is this a touch device ?        

Census_IsPenCapable  -  Is the device capable of pen input ?         

Wdft_IsGamer - Indicates whether the device is a gamer device or not based on its hardware combination.                 

HasDetections -  HasDetections is the ground truth and indicates that Malware was detected on the machine.

## Instructions

1. Download the dataset from kaggle , link provided in about section.
2. Upload it Your Google Drive , as i will be using Google Colab for this purpose.
3. I will try to provide all the reference link used in building this model.
4. If you are just reading this code , I will recommend to open the code notebook side-by-side, this will give you a better understanding. 

## The Code

First i have
