# Microsoft-Malware-prediction

## About

This is just a small research kind of work which will helps you to build an AI model to predict the probability of your windows machine getting infected by a malware. The dataset for this work have been taken from kaggle ADD LINK HERE, Which contains millions of records of windows machine and their status of being affected by a malware. The dataset contains total of 84 features from which  I have used only 15 features and only 1 lakh data, due to less RAM, for training the model and i got a accuracy of approx 60% in the end.

## Features

There total of 84 features but i have used only following 15 features.
